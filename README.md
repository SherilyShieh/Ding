HttpUtils.js: 
I created a web request tool based on my own created promise (since I can't introduce ES6, 
but I made it simply modular, so I want to be able to put php in a separate interface directory) and ajax, 
which solves the problem of only being able to reference php files in the same directory in both html and js files.
